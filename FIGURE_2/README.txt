This file contains scripts used to make figure 2 in the paper. 
Figures can be found in the output file and is generated by the script "main.py". 

To remake the figure, run script main.py, and for news simulations, change the variable SIMU value to 1.

FreeFem++ part: 
- function.edp
Contains functions for the reaction-diffusion model such as \mu(x)

- mesh_gen.edp
Contains function to generate initial condition (such as the domain \Omega) and the number of finite elements.

- modele_mixte_mu.edp
Compute the reaction diffusion model, must take the parameter file "params.txt" as input. 
params.txt gives all parameters and filenames of outputs. 

Python part:

Dependencies: 
matplotlib, numpy, pickle, pandas, os, copy, seaborn, scipy

- main.py
Compute the solution of the model using the freefem++ part and generate figures. 

- analysis.py
Contains function to compute numerical norm of solution computed 

- initial.py
Functions to read mesh grid and fix initial condition

- model.py 

Call freefem++ scripts to compute solution of the reaction-diffusion model and save the result Following params.txt.

- read.py 

Function to read results of the computation of the solution and converts it into a dataframe.
